I have used Vectors, for join keys of the two tables. 
We take the number of left rows and right rows, and data type as input from user, and then we fill these vectors with randomly generated data.
Each row can be either a one-one mapping, or it can be one-to-many mapping, which is decided again randomly. 
If its one to many then it can either have 1,2 or 3 rows mapped
